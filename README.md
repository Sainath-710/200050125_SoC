**Name of the Project**: Introduction to Web Development.

**Name of the Mentor**: Sagar Prasad.

**Name of the Mentee**: Sainath Vavilapalli.

* As a part of this project,I have learnt the concepts of **HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Angular and PHP**.

* I would like to elaborate more on the concepts learnt and the assignments we did each week:

**Week 1 and 2:(26th March - 11th April)**:

* In the first two weeks, we learnt the concepts of HTML and CSS.

* I mostly used W3Schools for learing the required concepts.

* Also,our mentor gave us an assignment to recreate the webpage [internet.iitb.ac.in](internet.iitb.ac.in) using the concepts learnt.

* My html code can be seen in the **Assignment1 folder**.The folder contains both the .txt version as well as the .html version of the code.

* Also,we were asked to start working on our portfolio website.

* Stopped the project for a few days due to Midsem(upto 7th May):

* However, we were asked to continue working on PortFolio website during the period if possible.

**Week 3 and 4:(Upto 18th May):**

* Learnt **CSS Media queries** and **JavaScript**.

* Used the concept of Media Queries to make the webpage created in Assignment1 more responsive.

* Again, I used W3 schools for learning these concepts.

* This time, the assignment asked us to create a switch that would enable the users to toggle between light theme and dark theme.

* We also introduced validation so that only people with LDAP ID in the range 200000000 to 202000000 can login.However there was no restriction on the password.

* My code(.html version as well as .txt version) can be found in the **Assignment2 folder**.

**22nd May to 10th June:**

* Started learning **Angular**.

* There were a lot of concepts and I used this playlist - [Angular Playlist](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fk6o8H4YMwGE%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3JH1doVqwr-q1aJuPrTZaqVNYhIx4Psf6VeUjWbV9D2Zpjsi8qVB4IOK8&h=AT1wUPSw0tRzuDb0RJUEABNXmdyz1kZRdNIgvszixkBh8_PRODFZN76dXp0OUuMIEX2MYgLBvSYpeQazYix-7tpzQc5VuOU1hpOy8onXYNcoGHUmPQnsjLxeoMHXu0jDQGLcDENpOmr7qfWjJIh4Rw) and I found it really useful.

* We were asked to build an application on our own by our mentor.

* So, I made a sample examination portal using the concepts of **Dynamic Binding, Two way Binding**, etc in **Angular**.

**Some key features:**
Basically, there are sections Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry which have to be answered, and as this is just a sample, I set the total time to be 2 minutes and 5 questions in each section.

* There will be an instructions page containing all the instructions before the start of the examination.

* Each question can be of either Single Correct or Multiple correct type and the type is displayed on the top right side of each question. 

* You can select or deselect an option by clicking on it.

* You get 4 marks for every question and -1 mark for every wrong answer.

* There is also an option to mark questions for review.All questions marked for review will also be considered for evaluation.

* You can view your answers compared with the correct answers(shown in green) and the marks for each question after submitting the examination.

* I deployed the application on **firebase**.

* Here is the **link to my firebase application** - [Examination](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fexamination-f6677.web.app%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0NpnCcqdcTO5OKo_O2wXl_VWngF-pprBv2ErwvjVA_KubXO6G4IQWCekg&h=AT1wUPSw0tRzuDb0RJUEABNXmdyz1kZRdNIgvszixkBh8_PRODFZN76dXp0OUuMIEX2MYgLBvSYpeQazYix-7tpzQc5VuOU1hpOy8onXYNcoGHUmPQnsjLxeoMHXu0jDQGLcDENpOmr7qfWjJIh4Rw)

* You can find my code in the folder named **'exam'**.

* Most of the important part of the code can be found in exam->src->app.

Break upto 30th June(Endsems)

**Final week:**

* We learnt **PHP** during the last week.Again I used W3 schools.However we were not given any specific assignment on PHP.We took it as a purely learning assignment.

* However we updated our **PortFolio Assignment** based on the concepts learnt so far.

* Here is the **link to my website** made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript - https://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~200050125/

* The code for my website can be found in the folder 'PortFolio Website',divided into index.html(containing the HTML code), CSS.css(containing the CSS code) and myScript.js containing the JavaScript code.
