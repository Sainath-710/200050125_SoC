So far,I have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS as part of SoC.
I learnt many concepts like styling various classes,inserting links,images,dividing the whole page into required number of rows and columns,etc..
Our mentor allotted an assignment which asked us to create a webpage similar to iitb.ac.in
I have completed the assignment based on the concepts learnt so far.
