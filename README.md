So far,I have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS as part of SoC.
I learnt many concepts like styling various classes,inserting links,images,dividing the whole page into required number of rows and columns,etc..
Our mentor allotted an assignment which asked us to create a webpage similar to iitb.ac.in
I have completed the assignment based on the concepts learnt so far.
In the second assignment, I made the page created as a part of Assignment 1 more reactive by adding CSS media queries.
I also added JavaScript to the page to validate login and add a new dark mode feature.
